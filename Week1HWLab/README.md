	1. The size refers to the predicted change in the response variable when we change the explanatory, in this case the predicted change would be 0.3776. This would mean that for every year older the mother gets an average increase of .37 mutations. This does match what I saw in 2.1. 

	2. This relationship is significant because the p-value is below .05.

2.3 

	1. The size of the relationship for paternal data would be 1.3538. This would mean that for every year older the father gets an average increase of 1.3538 mutations. Yes this matches, especially since it had a higher Y axis than the mothers. 

	2. This relationship is significant because the p-value is below .05. 

2.4

	The way you would do this is by writing an equation and plugging and chugging. Following the model y=B0+B1x where y is the mutations, x is the paternal age, B0 is the intercept and B1 is the slope (the coeff), 
		[paternal DNM]= 10.3263 + 1.3538(50.5)
		Number of Paternal DNMs at 50.5 years old= 78.6932 


2.6 

	1. I choose a t-test in order to compare the means of two groups, in this case being the maternally inherited DNMs/proband vs. paternally inherited DNMs/proband. 
	2. The ttest result was significant because the pvalue was below .05. There is a significant difference of around 53.403 standard deviations between the average number of maternally inherited DNMs and paternally inherited DNMs.
