1. for the first plot the results show that the allele frequency over time is decreasing throughout our simulation. What could be contributing to these results are the random frequencies of the next geneartion set by the binomial distribution. Taking these frequencies over time until fixation ( where 100% of the populatin either has the gene or doesn't) gives us our results. Biologically this means that the alelle is being lost in the population over time, as less and less people have it due to random chance, given the assumption of genetic drift in the wright-fisher function. 
2. For the plot in exercise two ( not the histogram), sampling from the binomial distribution for each run of a simulation is random, that way we can visualize allele frequencies trajectories and make a prediction. If we were to change this assumption, let's say non-random mating was occuring, this would bias the allele frequencies over time, which could bias the trajectory of our line plot depending on the goal of the non-random mating. Nature and biology violates random assumptions all the time, ecological niches, migration, mutation, etc. 
3. In the third exercise where we are using the model to investigate how changing the population size affects the time to fixation ( allele frequency 0 or 1), changinng the random assumption to allow something like non-random mating would mean that there were more variables involved than we can control for i.e. changes in allele frequencies (biases) due in part to non-random mating. Results would probably bias again towards whatever the intention of non-random mating is, skewing results to not reflect population changes over time.
